# BACKLOG — @adhd/apigen-cli

Package-scoped log. Repo-wide context lives in the root [BACKLOG.md](../../BACKLOG.md)
(§ _Extraction performance + memory-leak work (2026-07-02)_).

## Fixed

### PERF-APIGEN-001 (orchestrator side) — RESOLVED 2026-07-02

`buildDescriptor()` now creates ONE `ExtractionSession` per run, threads it through
`extractSource` and the step-5 `generateSchemas` composition loop (previously a second
full ts-morph Project per source), and disposes it in `finally`. Guard:
`src/test/perf.spec.ts` (descriptor deep-equality across cached runs, heap flatness
with real gc, warm-run bound) — runs by default in the forks pool with `--expose-gc`.
Bench: `npx nx run apigen-cli:bench` (fixtures under `tmp/apigen/bench`).

### BUG-APIGEN-016 (serve side) — bare `python3` spawns — RESOLVED 2026-07-02

`serve` pre-provisions the managed interpreter via `@adhd/apigen-python-env` before
spawning Python hosts (first-time venv build no longer eats the per-host ready budget)
and pins children via `APIGEN_PYTHON`. A user-supplied `APIGEN_PYTHON` is respected; one
set by a previous `startServe` in the same process is not treated as a user override
(extras may need widening — see `_managedPython` in `src/lib/commands/serve.ts`).

### Leak fixes — RESOLVED 2026-07-02

- `resolve-tsconfig.ts`: `builtinTsconfigPath()` memoized — no more one mkdtemp per call
  in long-running serve/watch.
- `serve.ts` gRPC proxy sessions: 60s idle eviction + `unref()` so cached h2c sessions
  neither linger after silent backend death nor hold the event loop open.
