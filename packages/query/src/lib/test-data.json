        "long_description": "Teamcenter, from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio of software and services, is a modern, adaptable PLM system that connects people and processes across functional silos with a digital thread for innovation. Teamcenter helps customers plan, develop and deliver products, while providing secure, controlled access to a company's most sensitive intellectual property throughout the lifecycle of the product, from conceptualization to end of life.\nWhen implemented in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) deployment model on Cloud, Teamcenter can help improve infrastructure performance, flexibly scale to meet project demands, and lower the total cost of ownership. Additionally, it enables customers to gain those benefits along with the speed, scale, security, and sustainability of the Cloud. Bringing Siemens' Teamcenter to the cloud enables customers to more easily break down silos to combine the realms of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), enabling the fusion of data from the real world of automation with the digital world of information and engineering technology.\nCustomers of all sizes and in all industries trust Teamcenter to help them develop and make the products of the future and by bringing Teamcenter to Cloud, we are enabling more organizations to speed their adoption of PLM, getting them up, running, and productive with innovative capabilities more quickly.",

        "short_description": "Teamcenter Simulation software is a simulation process and data management (SPDM) solution for engineers and analysts to drive functional performance engineering workflows. It lets you use Teamcenter - a leading product lifecycle management (PLM) solution - to manage all your simulation and physical testing processes, data, tools and workflows and connect them to the other product data that you are already managing for complete traceability and visibility to all stakeholders. Engineering teams use Teamcenter Simulation to stay connected and collaborate efficiently across the digital thread.",
        "long_description": "Teamcenter Simulation allows organizations to get more control and a better understanding of their engineering data and processes. As an integral module of the Teamcenter platform, Teamcenter Simulation allows all simulation and physical test-related data to be managed in context with product data such as CAD Designs, material data, product parameters, product requirements, etc. Teamcenter provides a single source of truth to the entire organization and connects simulation activities to organizations' digital threads. The Teamcenter Simulation data model supports all types of simulation and physical test data. Providing access to multi-domain engineering data in a structured and organized environment means that engineers can more easily compare datasets or perform correlation or validation work. Teamcenter Simulation provides a flexible and seamless framework for configuring and launching all simulation applications, either interactively or through workflows and on a local or remote machine. Files needed for the external application, metadata, and structure information are automatically exchanged between Teamcenter Simulation and the application. Built-in connectors provide a deep level of integration with Simcenter simulation and test tools, however the tool launch framework is fully open and customizable and can be integrated with any 3rd party application. Using Teamcenter Simulation to launch simulation and analysis tools not only saves the analyst time by streamlining the process, but also eliminates errors by automatically passing up-to-date input data to the application. Teamcenter not only automates synchronization between design and simulation but can speed up the search for data with comprehensive capabilities for query and navigation of simulation data. Because all relationships between data are retained, users can navigate between associated product, model, analysis and results in a specially designed relationship browser. To search, queries can be based on attributes, including regular properties such as username, program name, as well as engineering specific properties such as simulation domain, analysis type, or by relationship such as an analysis performed on a specific design variant. Combining the power of relationships and queries, users can quickly identify all simulations that were performed on a particular design variant or determine what tool was used to generate a specific result. Teamcenter simulation also automates the transformation of complex product structures into an equivalent CAE structure by executing predefined rules, such as filter rules, re-use rules, include rules and others. With Teamcenter Simulation, product owners and program managers have direct access to simulation and test results whenever required, presented in the broader context of the PLM environment, allowing them to progress their development program and document key performance indicators (KPIs) without placing additional demands on analysts. Simulation results are captured in a lightweight format for quick visualization, allowing stakeholders to review the results without needing to use dedicated simulation tools or postprocessors. Because Teamcenter Simulation manages the analysis process in the context of the overall digital thread, you can use the verification management process to create a tight connection between the product development program and the analysis tasks which are performed in parallel to it. This links simulation and test activities directly to verification requests that define the requirements, input data, and required testing scope. KPI's are automatically recorded against targets, supporting sign-off on requirements.",
